FEATURIST Backlog
-----------------
- specify cover page somehow
- specify TOC generation
- reliably strip out @tags from top of feature description
  (need to not accidentally remove feature description text with legimate @'s in)
- Nice PDF formatting, indenting of sections in particular
- Page numbers on PDF version
- Test script document generation
- Trace matrix document generation
- Test as a gem, esp. the /bin stuff -- is that right? Work on Windows and *nix?
- The Text::Format.paragraphs method is the closest thing to what I want for
  text spec output example it mangles single likes, making them run together
  as a paragraph. the .center method (oddly) is closer but indentation is FUBAR.
  Can this be improved? Text spec output not likely the main format...
- HTML format output?
