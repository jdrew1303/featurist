FEATURIST Backlog
-----------------
- Sorting/resorting of sections based on order specified in featurist-config.yml
- specify TOC generation (how to get the right page numbers per section/feature?)
- PDF format -- depending on formatting in .feature files can get some weird line wraps. What to do...
  (Warn on processing .feature files with line length > x?? but proportional fonts make it hard to pick sensible x value)
- Test script document generation
- Trace matrix document generation
- Test as a gem, esp. the /bin stuff -- is that right? Work on Windows and *nix?
- The Text::Format.paragraphs method is the closest thing to what I want for
  text spec output example it mangles single likes, making them run together
  as a paragraph. the .center method (oddly) is closer but indentation is FUBAR.
  Can this be improved? Text spec output not likely the main format...
- HTML format output?

DONE
----
- reliably strip out @tags from top of feature description
  (need to not accidentally remove feature description text with legimate @'s in)
- specify cover page somehow
- Page numbers on PDF version
- Nice PDF formatting, indenting of sections in particular
- PDF format -- how to do headers and footers. Image/logo in header?
